to analyze the MD simulations use the DHFR_SCA_analysis.ipynb and DHFR_SCA_analysis_human.ipynb notebooks. All of the necessary associated files are included. The hinge distance and dihedral plots can be made using Dihedrals and Hinge distance_2-CFA-Copy1.ipynb and the RMSD can be made with RMSD-Distance_plots2_copy.ipynb. For recalculating SCA, the multi-sequence alignment file is PF00186_35.fasta and after running SCA using pySCA the results can be analyzed with the ca_analysis.py script.
